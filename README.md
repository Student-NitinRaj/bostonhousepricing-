🏠 Real Estate House Price Prediction

This project is designed to predict the price of houses on the basis of different socio-economic and geographical criteria. Using a Machine Learning model, the system analyzes multiple input features such as crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, accessibility to highways, and other important factors, and then predicts the expected house price.

🔑 Key Features

✅ End-to-End ML Pipeline – Data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation

✅ Web Application (Flask) – User-friendly form where users can input values and get predictions

✅ REST API – Integrated with Postman or any application for API testing and deployment

✅ Interactive Frontend – Simple HTML form to enter house features and see predicted prices instantly

📊 Tech Stack

Python – Data analysis and ML model development

Scikit-Learn – Model training and evaluation

Flask – Web framework to serve ML model as an API

HTML/CSS – Frontend interface

Pickle – For saving trained model, scaler, and feature order

🎯 Real-World Use Case

This project can be used by:

🏢 Real Estate Companies – For quick price estimation of properties

🧑‍💼 Property Dealers / Brokers – To guide clients with data-driven pricing

👨‍👩‍👧 Individuals / Buyers – To evaluate whether a property is fairly priced

It provides a fast, reliable, and data-driven approach to understand how different factors affect property values.

🚀 Hackathon Showcase

Demonstrates ML model deployment with a real-life use case

Solves a common problem that everyone can relate to – real estate pricing

Combines Data Science + Web Development into a single project

Can be extended to include larger datasets, visualizations, or even live real-estate data APIs

⚡ How It Works

User enters property details (CRIM, ZN, RM, TAX, LSTAT, etc.) via web form

Input data is scaled and processed using the trained model pipeline

The model predicts the expected house price

Output is displayed on the web interface or returned as JSON via API
